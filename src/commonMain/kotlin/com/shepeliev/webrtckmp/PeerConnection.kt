     * send yet.
     *
     *
     * When the application does want to begin sending a track, it can call
     * RtpSender.setTrack, which doesn't require any additional SDP negotiation.

     * Example use:
     * <pre>
     * `audioSender = pc.createSender("audio", "stream1");
     * videoSender = pc.createSender("video", "stream1");
     * // Do normal SDP offer/answer, which will kick off ICE/DTLS and negotiate
     * // media parameters....
     * // Later, when the endpoint is ready to actually begin sending:
     * audioSender.setTrack(audioTrack, false);
     * videoSender.setTrack(videoTrack, false);

     * functionality, and properly implementing transceivers would have required
     * a great deal more work.

     * @param streamId The ID of the MediaStream that this sender's track will
     * be associated with when SDP is applied to the remote
     * PeerConnection. If createSender is used to create an
     * audio and video sender that should be synchronized, they
     * should use the same stream ID.
